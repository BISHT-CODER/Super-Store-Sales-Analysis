# Project Background
The Super Store dataset represents transactional sales data from 2014 to 2017 across multiple product categories,
customer segments, regions, and discount levels.

The business wanted to understand sales performance, profitability trends,
and the impact of discounts to support data-driven decision-making.

Before building the dashboards, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to validate data quality
and understand sales, profit, discount patterns, and seasonality, which guided metric selection and visualization design.

Key EDA findings  informed the identification of discount-driven profit erosion and seasonal demand patterns.

## Project Objectives
• Analyze sales and profit performance overtime.

• Identify profitable and loss - making regions & categories .

• Understand discount impact on profitability.

• Track profitability trends and margins.

## Key Areas of analysis
#### Sales Performance Analysis 
  Evaluation of overall sales trends, year-over-year growth, and seasonal patterns.
#### Profitability & Margin Analysis 
  Analysis of profit trends and profit margins to  assess business efficency and sustainability.
#### Discount Impact Analysis 
  Examination of how different discount levels affect profitability and identify loss_making discount bands.
#### Regional Performance Analysis 
  Comparison of sales and profit across regions to identify high-performing and underperforming areas.

   • The most significant sales acceleration occurred between 2016 to 2017, supported by a parallel increase in order volume.
   
   • Order volume closely tracked sales performance across all years, confirming that revenue growth was primarily driven by higher demand rater than price increases.
   
   • Monthly sales patterns indicate clear seasonality, with stronger performance during the second half of the year (Q3-Q4).

### Profit Trend 
   • Overall, profit increased steadily from 2014 to 2017, showing that the business was not only selling more but also earning better over time.
   
   • Profit growth became stronger in the later years, especially during 2016 and 2017, as  
     sales volumes increased and costs were ma
   
   • Monthly profit patterns show clear seasonality, with higher profits generally seen  
     toward the end of the year , when customer demand was higher.
   
   • The Technology category consistently generated the highest profit, making it the most reliable contributor
     to overall profitability.
   
   • High discount levels had a negative impact on profit, and in some cases led to loss, even when sales are high.

##  Reccomendations :
  • Control high discounting: Limit discounts above 20%, as they consistently reduce profitability despite higher sales volumes.
  
  • Prioritize high-margin categories: Expand and promote Technology products, which contribute over 50% of total profit.
  
  • Improve underperforming regions: Apply targeted pricing and localized promotions in the Central and South regions to boost profitability.
  
  • Leverage the Consumer segment: Focus marketing and loyalty efforts on the Consumer segment, the most consistent profit contributor.
  
  • Capitalize on seasonality: Align promotions and inventory planning with Q3–Q4 peak demand to maximize sales while protecting margins.
